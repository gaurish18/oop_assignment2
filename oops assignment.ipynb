    "The close() function is used to close a file that has been opened using the open() function in Python. It is essential to close a file for several important reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Resource Management: When you open a file, the operating system allocates system resources to manage that file, such as file handles and buffers. Failing to close a file can lead to resource leaks, which can be particularly problematic if your program opens a large number of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Data Integrity: When you write data to a file, it may not be immediately flushed to the disk; instead, it might be held in a buffer. Closing the file ensures that any remaining data in the buffer is flushed and written to the file. If you don't close the file properly, some data may not be saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Concurrency and Sharing: In many cases, other programs or processes may want to access the same file. Closing the file makes it available for other programs to access, reducing the risk of conflicts and ensuring proper data sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Portability: Properly closing files helps ensure your code is more portable across different platforms and systems. While most modern operating systems will automatically close files when your program exits, relying on this behavior is not a good practice, as it may not be consistent across all systems.\n",

    "To close a file, you can use the close() method of the file object. \n",
